# XAI-Model-for-early-prediction-of-Parkinson-detection-using-Deep-Learning
This research presents an innovative approach to early Parkinson's disease (PD) prediction using Deep Learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, coupled with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). The integration of LIME generates visual indicators, offering insights into the LSTM model's decision-making process for healthcare professionals. This transparency builds trust and aids informed clinical decisions. The combined model aims to identify PD in its prodromal stages, facilitating timely intervention and improving neuroprotective therapy effectiveness. The proposed LSTM model achieves high accuracy (96.35%), precision (0.984), F1-Score (0.966), and True Positive Rate (0.943). The LSTM model forms the basis of an XAI framework, where LIME enhances transparency and interpretability.
